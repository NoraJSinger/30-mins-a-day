30 Minutes a Day is a web application for aspiring writers, who struggle to "practice" writing regularly.  They say, you need to write at least 30 minutes a day in order to develop the discipline required to become a writer. While my website won't and can't force anyone to write, it provides a unique environment to do so.  After registering/ logging in the user is redirected to the writing area, where they can type in the day's worth of wisdom (or anything else) or if inspiration fails them, ask for a one-word prompt. A countdown from 30 minutes starts upon logging in.  In case the user requests a writing prompt (meaning, they couldn't think of anything else yet to write about), the timer starts again (no cheating!).
